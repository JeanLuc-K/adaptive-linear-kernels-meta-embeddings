# adaptive-linear-kernels-meta-embeddings
This repository contains the code and experiments for learning adaptive linear kernels for structured data via meta-feature embeddings. The project extends traditional linear kernel methods by learning data-dependent transformations that enhance linear separability in complex datasets.
